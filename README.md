# Trauma-informed language standard

An open, machine-readable trauma-informed language standard for how organizations talk about people, including the full human-centered language standard as its base.

Maintained by [GoldenDoodle AI](https://goldendoodleai.com). Editor: Laura Braden.

## Install (start here)

**Pick one layer:**

| Layer | When to use |
|---|---|
| **Human-centered language standard** (base) | Any organization that cares how it speaks about people |
| **Trauma-informed standard** | Organizations serving people affected by trauma (shelter, DV program, foster care nonprofit). Includes the base automatically. |

**Then grab the ready-to-load file for your tool:**

| Tool | What to paste or upload |
|---|---|
| **Any model** (system prompt, RAG, API) | `packaging/compiled/human-centered-language.md` or `packaging/compiled/trauma-informed-communications.md` |
| **Claude** | `packaging/releases/human-centered-language.zip`, `trauma-informed-communications.zip`, or `human-voice.zip` (or [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/GoldenDoodleAI/trauma-informed-language/releases) when published). Upload under Settings → Customize → Skills. Or tell Claude to fetch this repo and set up the skill for you. |
| **ChatGPT** | Paste `packaging/chatgpt/human-centered-language.md` or `trauma-informed-communications.md` into a Project's instructions. Upload sector vocabulary from `okf/standard/vocabulary/` if needed. |
| **Gemini** | Paste `packaging/gemini/human-centered-language.md` or `trauma-informed-communications.md` as a Gem's instructions. |
| **Cursor / repo agent** | Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md). Load `packaging/compiled/` by default. |
| **Brand voice** (optional, step 9) | Interview: `okf/templates/voice-interview.md`. Blank profile: `okf/templates/voice-profile.md`. |

All install paths live under [`packaging/`](packaging/). See [packaging/README.md](packaging/README.md) for what each folder contains.

**Legacy filenames (one release):** `packaging/compiled/dignified-language.md` and `packaging/compiled/trauma-informed.md` are byte-identical copies of the new primary files for backward compatibility.

Per-model packaging files are intentionally separate. They may drift slightly in preamble or formatting; `okf/` is the authoring source (see below).

**Agents already at this repo:** load `packaging/compiled/human-centered-language.md` or `packaging/compiled/trauma-informed-communications.md`. Do not run setup or git publish steps.

Model behavior changes with each release. Before choosing a model, check [MODELS.md](MODELS.md) for the current roster.

### Claude (claude.ai)

1. Download `human-centered-language.zip`, `trauma-informed-communications.zip`, or `human-voice.zip` from `packaging/releases/` (or [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/GoldenDoodleAI/trauma-informed-language/releases) when published). Each layer zip contains `SKILL.md` and `standard.md`.
2. In Claude, go to **Settings → Customize → Skills**. If Code execution and File creation are not already on, turn them on first; skills will not run without them.
3. Click **Add**, then **Upload a skill**, and select the zip.
4. Toggle it on. Claude will apply the standard automatically to writing about the people you serve, or you can invoke it directly.

Faster option, if your Claude has web browsing and file creation on: tell it to fetch this repo and set up the trauma-informed or human-centered language skill for you.

On a Claude Team or Enterprise plan, an admin can provision this for the whole organization at once under **Organization settings → Skills**.

### ChatGPT

1. Create a Project.
2. Open the project's settings and paste the contents of `packaging/chatgpt/human-centered-language.md` or `trauma-informed-communications.md` into the project instructions field.
3. If your sector has its own vocabulary file under `okf/standard/vocabulary/` (housing, disability, substance use, mental health), upload it too as a project file.

(Custom GPTs are not the recommended path here. OpenAI has stopped new GPT creation for personal accounts and is retiring the feature entirely through the rest of 2026. Projects is the stable option.)

### Gemini

1. Create a Gem.
2. Paste `packaging/gemini/human-centered-language.md` or `trauma-informed-communications.md` as its instructions.

### Any other agent or RAG pipeline

Paste `packaging/compiled/human-centered-language.md` or `trauma-informed-communications.md` as system context. For platform-specific formatting, use the matching folder under `packaging/`.

## What this is

Most organizations that serve people have opinions about language. Very few have written them down in a form an AI model can follow. This repository is that form.

It is a directory of markdown files with YAML frontmatter, following the [Open Knowledge Format](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog/blob/main/okf/SPEC.md) conventions, so it can be loaded into Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, an open-weight model, or any agent that reads files. Humans can read it too. That is the point.

There are two layers:

**The human-centered language standard** is the base. Person-first language, no deficit framing, the organization is never the hero, plain language by default, and reporting standards for sensitive topics. Any organization that cares how it speaks about people can adopt it. A medical association, a housing coalition, and a trade group can all run on it.

**The trauma-informed standard** sits on top of the base and requires it. It adds SAMHSA's Four R's and Six Principles, four additional practices aimed at fundraising and storytelling, and a Crisis protocol. It is written for organizations serving people affected by trauma and for the communicators who work alongside them.

The base is a subset of the trauma-informed standard, not a lighter version of it. If you adopt trauma-informed, you have adopted the base.

## How the standard is tested

Every week, the standard is run against a fixed set of 45 writing prompts on the current production models from each major vendor and the leading open-weight models. Each prompt runs three ways: with no standard loaded, with the human-centered language base, and with the trauma-informed standard on top. Outputs are scored by a three-family judge panel against the practice files in this repo, with human calibration on every run.

The prompt set is in `tests/prompts/`. **The Human-Centered Language Benchmark** publishes methodology, judge configuration, and raw outputs with each report so anyone can regrade. Benchmark engineered by MKTNG.

<!-- TODO: replace with the public methodology URL when published on goldendoodleai.com -->

Results from the first four weekly runs are a calibration series and are not published as findings.

## Source of truth (maintainers and scoring)

**End users should install from [`packaging/`](packaging/), not by picking individual files under `okf/`.**

`okf/` is the machine-readable source catalog. It is what maintainers edit, what `scripts/build.py` renders into `packaging/`, and what the weekly test bench scores against. If compiled or platform packaging disagrees with `okf/`, trust `okf/` and regenerate packaging.

```
okf/
  index.md             Bundle directory listing (OKF v0.2)
  load-order.md        Sequencing playbook for fine-grained loads
  standard/            Human-centered language standard (base)
    principles.md      What the standard is for
    precedence.md      How these practices interact with brand voice and user requests
    rules/             One file per practice (maintainer path; public text says practices)
    vocabulary/        Swappable sector vocabulary (housing, substance use, ...)
    protocols/         Rewrite protocol
  trauma-informed/     Trauma-informed standard (requires standard/)
    four-rs.md
    six-principles.md
    rules/             Fundraising and storytelling practices
    protocols/         Crisis protocol
  modules/             Optional add-ons
  templates/           Brand voice templates (profile blank + interview megaprompt)
packaging/             Ready-to-load versions for each platform (what users install)
plugins/               Marketplace plugin stubs (one skill per plugin)
tests/                 Golden prompts and the scoring rubric
scripts/               Build script that renders packaging/
```

For fine-grained control (custom loaders, scoring, or contributing), walk `okf/` using [okf/load-order.md](okf/load-order.md). [okf/index.md](okf/index.md) lists bundle contents.

**Optional modules:** Human voice (`okf/modules/human-voice.md`) ships in `packaging/releases/human-voice.zip` and marketplace manifests alongside the two standards.

## Model behavior

Instructions land differently across models and change with each release. See [How the standard is tested](#how-the-standard-is-tested) for the weekly bench and [MODELS.md](MODELS.md) for the current model roster.

## Contributing

Practices change when practitioners say they should. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Sector vocabulary contributions are especially welcome.
